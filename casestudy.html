                <h1 id=problemTitle>Problem & Solution</h1>
                <h4 id="problemText">It’s easy to overlook or be unaware of the outdoor recreation offerings where we live. Few apps other than Google Maps document and locate which facilities, such as fitness equipment, dog parks, playgrounds, and sports fields, are available for public use.
                </h4>
                <h4 id="problemText2">Recess could help users locate, use, and review their public outdoor recreation offerings, so that they are able to enjoy their active time outside with friends, pets, and family in their own communities.

            <h1 id="userTitle">Understanding the Users</h1>
            <h4 id="userText">Our user research started with creating a proto-persona who enjoys spending time outside at the park, but wants to know which parks offer fitness and recreation facilities. We interviewed 5 users who love active recreation, have dogs or kids, and enjoy spending time outside; we also created a survey about parks and recreation use, which received 96 responses. 

                <br><br>The research uncovered many common themes: who users visit parks with; parks & recreation features they seek; travel distances & methods; and, how they search for parks and recreation areas. We used these themes to create our final User Persona, who visits parks with her family and dog, likes exercising, and wants to find ways to accommodate all of her family members at the park.

                    <h4 id="recessDescText">After brainstorming, identifying, and prioritizing the app features we wanted to build, we worked on user flows for the app and began wireframing the prototypes at low- and mid-fidelity. We tested each iteration to find what features functioned well. We found that the interactive map, the foundation of our app, was causing the most user issues. We adjusted the map in the final high-fidelity prototype to make it easier to use.  </h4>
